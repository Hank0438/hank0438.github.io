Malware use various packers to make malware analysis difficult.
Packers or obfuscators can be categoried to following class:
  1. compiling time
  2. linking time
  3. static binary

For the static binary, the most often way is to hide the original entry point (OEP). such as:
* UPX
  * find the last `jmp` in the EP function of the packed malware
  * 

For the compiling time, the obfuscator is based on intermediate language of compiler. such as:
* ollvm

For the linking time, the dynamically resoled API by API hash can be implement in this way.
